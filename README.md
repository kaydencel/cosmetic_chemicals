# Abstract
This project aimed to analyze the chemicals found in cosmetic products that can be harmful and cause long-term health issues such as cancer and allergies. This can affect people of all ages worldwide as everyone uses some form of cosmetic products every day. This data analysis will help educate consumers to make better choices when purchasing these products so that they will benefit their health. The dataset is from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). From the dataset, we used brand name, product name and cosmetic category, chemical name, dates reported and discontinued date. The methods we implemented was get_stats, which created groupings and got the top 5 counts, created a bar chart, and created a pie chart. We found that Sephora, bareMinerals, NYX, Revolon, and Tarte have the highest number of products with chemicals. We found that makeup products make up 66.5% of the dataset, and that titanium dioxide is found in 91.6% of the products in the data.
